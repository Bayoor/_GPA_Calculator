# Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculator

This repository contains a simple Java program for calculating Grade Point Average (GPA). The program allows users to dynamically input their course name, course code, course unit, and scores. Subsequently, the program calculates the GPA, displays the result on the console, and presents the entered courses and values in a tabular form.

The code was developed as part of my assessment for the FirstBank Tech Academy 2.0 Program.

## Code Structure Overview
This program follows an Object-Oriented Approach, organized in different files and also maintain a clean and readable code structure


### Files
- GPACalculatorApp.java: The main entry point for the program, allowing users to input course details.
- GPALogic.java: Contains the GPALogic class, that manages the GPA calculations and  displays result to the course in form of a table/tabular form.
- CourseModel.java: Defines the CourseModel class that represent a course with its attributes.

### Formular used:
-Quality point = course unit * grade unit.
-GPA = total quality point / total grade unit.
